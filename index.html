            <p class="non-fiction-block5-writer">by Philip Kerr</p>
            <p class="non-fiction-block5-description">
              Berlin, March, 1943. A month has passed since the stunning defeat
              at Stalingrad. Though Hitler insists Germany is winning the war,
              commanders on the ground know better. Morale is low, discipline at
              risk. Now word has reached Berlin of a Red massacre of Polish
              officers in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk. If true, the message
              it would send to the troops is clear: Fight on or risk certain
              death.

            <p class="drama-block1-description">
              Teenage years are the most difficult and puzzling years for both
              the teenager and his or her parent. This is when children begin to
              develop their own identity, seek individualism and veer away from
              their parents. They can be rebellious, defy norms and traditions,
              and stay cooped up in their rooms for days on end. Everything the
              parent says is anathema to them.

              Set before and during the Great War, Birdsong captures the drama

              traumatic experiences, from the clandestine love affair that tears
              apart the family with whom he lives, to the unprecedented
              experiences of the war itself.

              People have been telling their love stories for thousands of
              years. It is the greatest common human experience. And yet, love
              stories coach us to believe that love is selective, somehow, that
              it can be boxed in and easily defined. This is a collection of
              eleven remarkable essays that widen the frame of reference.
