            <h3>The Nazi Hunters</h3>
            <p class="non-fiction-block4-writer">by Damien Lewis</p>
            <p class="non-fiction-block4-description">
              The Nazi Hunters is the incredible, hitherto untold story of the
              most secret chapter in the SAS's history. Officially, the world's
              most elite special forces unit was dissolved at the end of the
              Second World War, and not reactivated until the 1950s. Among their
              last actions was a disastrous commando raid into occupied France
              in 1944, which ended in the capture, torture and execution of 31
              soldiers.

            <p class="non-fiction-block5-description">
              Berlin, March, 1943. A month has passed since the stunning defeat
              at Stalingrad. Though Hitler insists Germany is winning the war,
              commanders on the ground know better. Morale is low, discipline at
              risk. Now word has reached Berlin of a Red massacre of Polish
              officers in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk. If true, the message
              it would send to the troops is clear: Fight on or risk certain
              death.

              Teenage years are the most difficult and puzzling years for both
              the teenager and his or her parent. This is when children begin to
              develop their own identity, seek individualism and veer away from
              their parents. They can be rebellious, defy norms and traditions,
              and stay cooped up in their rooms for days on end. Everything the
              parent says is anathema to them.

              Set before and during the Great War, Birdsong captures the drama

              traumatic experiences, from the clandestine love affair that tears
              apart the family with whom he lives, to the unprecedented
              experiences of the war itself.

              years. It is the greatest common human experience. And yet, love
